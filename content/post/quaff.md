I bought my first electric vehicle (EV) recently: a 2017 Chevy Bolt with a new
battery. With electric comes a whole new way to think about fueling it up. It
takes hours and hours to fill up but you can do it at home. So that's cool.

It didn't take me long to figure out how to mentally calculate how long it would
take to charge at 240V and 32A, or about 7.680kW. Taking into account that
charging isn't 100% efficient. It takes about 30 minutes to charge one notch on
the fuel gauge (there are 20 notches).

The real problem is with kWhs. Of all the units for energy -- joule, BTU,
calorie, etc. -- it is the most awkward. I have a master's degree in EE and I
find it difficult to say kW or kWh in the right context.

It has the same issues as light-year without the charm. A light-year is a unit
of distance but is often misunderstood as a time. Still, we love it because it
is fun to say and it tells us how old the light is from the star that is some
number of light-years away. kWh is neither cool to say nor is it very useful. No
one talks about how many kilowatts their circuit can deliver; its volts and
amps.

Last Wednesday, I was out running and thinking through it. "15 amp hours at 240V
for each notch. My car takes 32 amps and the cars battery capacity is 60 kWh. I
needed something else to distinguish amps from amp hours and kilowatts from
kilowatt-hours so I came up with amff and quaff.

Amff should be pretty obvious. You put amp together with an 'h' for hour and you
get amph. Except, I wanted to use an 'f' because it appears similar to an
integral sign (âˆ«) and an amff is an amp integrated over an hour of time. Why two
'f's? I think it makes it more substantial.

Quaff is similar except you might expect a 'th' sound at the end (i.e. kwath).
However, I learned Portuguese as a young man living in Portugal and I gained an
appreciation for how difficult it is for many in the world to say the dental
fricative, just as it was difficult for me to say their lh sound.

One quaff is equal to 3.6M joules of energy in terms of SI units. This makes
sense since a joule is a watt-second 

When charging something with quaffs, it can be called quaffing. For example, the
car is quaffing. Now, my family says things like "don't forget to quaff the car
when you get home."
